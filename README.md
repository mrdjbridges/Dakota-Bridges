//Jump & Shoot Man 
A java game that a fellow student and I created in an earlier semester while at Bossie Parrish Community College.
We had three months to create the game from scratch and had no prior experience in game design. 
In hindsight we definitley could have made it more modular and should have. 
But I am definitley proud of the game and I learned a lot from it, such as teamwork skills, meeting deadlines, setting realistic 
goals and setting a good pace.

//Roll Call 
A website that a fellow student and I built to introduce a way to incentive student participation in school events. 
This was done in 8 weeks with neither of us having no prior experience in version control, PHP, MVC frameworks, scrum or 
agile methodologies. 
I am extremley proud of all I learned while working on this project.
